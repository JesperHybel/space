# Resources for spatial computation in R
The package sp and sf are very important for handling spatial data. 

The basic idea is to structure the data as a data frame with each row being an observation as is standard. The attributes observed defines columns, one for each attribute, as is also standard. However because the observations are associated with a location in space a speciel column i needed storing what is referred to as the observations geometry.
