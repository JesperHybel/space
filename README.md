# Resources for spatial computation in R
This is a collection of resources for spatial computation in R.

# SP and SF packages
A good place to begin is to build an understanding of the package sp and the package sf. Both introduce classes of objects and associated methods used for handling spatial data in R.

Definitiion of Spatial data
Let a data set be i=1,...,N observations on some attributes K attributes such that x = [x(i1),...,x(iK)].

What is spatial data? One way to think of spatial data is to Basically spatial data are observations where each


The sp package provides classes and methods for dealing with spatial data in
R. The spatial data structures implemented include points, lines, polygons, rings
and grids; each of them with or without attribute data. The classes are
S4 classes. 




The sp package has an easily accesible introductory vignette called sp: classes and methods for spatial data
can be downloaded from CRAN at
